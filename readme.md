# Setup
```
var auth = require("l2pAuth");
auth.setClientID('YOURCLIENTID.app.rwth-aachen.de')
```

# Workflow

The OAuth workflow is the following:

1. Obtaining a user code
2. Obtaining an OAuth access token
3. Calling the API

and optional
 * Refreshing the token
 * validating the token
 * invalidating the token

 ## Obtaining a user code

 The first thing you will have to do is to let the user authorize your application.
 For that you have to provide him with a webpage to login and authorize. To do that 
 call the `obtainUserCode(callback)` function of l2pAuth. Example:

 ```
auth.obtainUserCode(function(response){console.log(response)})
 ```

 The `response` object stores the information sent back by the server and stores the following fields:

 * `device_code` : The code of the current device, will be used in later processes
 * `user_code` : The user code for verification
 * `verification_url` : An URL to pass to the user, so that he can authorize the app
 * `expires_in` : Time when the codes will expire
 * `interval` : Polling interval to get Auth token

 These are accessed in a normal javascript fashion, that is for example `response.device_code`.

 ## Obtaining OAuth tokens
 After the user has authorize the app you are ready to request an OAuth token. This is done using the
 `getTokens(device_code, callback)` function. The device code is the one from the previous step. The callback works 
 the same as before and is a response object, that in the case of two distinct errors only has the status field with value "error: authorization pending" or "error: slow down" when the user has not yet authorized the app or the polling was done too fast respectively.

 If there was no error the response object has the following fields:

* `access_token` : The access token used for the API
* `token_type` : The type of the token (unused here but will always be "bearer")
* `expires_in` : When the token will expire
* `refresh_token` : The refresh token to request an new access token

## Accessing the API
Accessing the API is done via the access token. There is a build in method for the course info called `courseinfo(token,callback)` and a general method that takes a custom url as input called `callAPI(token,apiurl,callback)`. 

The response is dependent on the call, please refer to the L2P API documentation for further information.

## Refreshing a token
If the access token timed out, it is possible to request a new one using the refresh token, this is done via `refreshToken(refreshToken, callback)`.

The response will have the following fields:

* `status` : will be "ok"
* `expires_in` : When the access token expires
* `access_token` = The new token
* `token_type` = will again be "bearer"

If the refresh token expired (after 6 month) you will get `"error": "authorization invalid."`

## Token validation
If you wish to see if a token is valid, call the `tokenValidation(accessToken, callback)` function. The response will have the following fields:

* `status`: If the request was "ok"
* `audience`: "Your App Name"
* `scope`: will be "l2p.rwth userinfo.rwth"
* `expires_in`: When it expires
* `state`: The state will be "valid" if the token can still be used

## Token invalidation
If you are sure that you no longer want to use the API for this user you can destroy the access and refresh token using the function `invalidateToken(refreshToken)`. As there will be no response object, there is no callback function.

# Example
Here is an example of the workflow:

```javascript
var auth = require("l2pAuth");
auth.setClientID('YOURCLIENTID.app.rwth-aachen.de')
auth.obtainUserCode(function(response){
console.log(response.verification_url); //Show this url to your user
device_code = response.device_code; //save device code
})

//...
//The user has now verified the app

auth.getTokens(device_code,function(response){
    //save tokens
    acessToken = response.access_token;
    refreshToken = response.refresh_token;

    //validate token and show output
    auth.tokenValidation(acessToken, function(response){
        console.log(response);
    });
});
```
